# ZedSpaceGame

SpaceZedGame is my first ever game made in python with the pygame library.

In the actual code i.e. in the file: pygamevs.py, I have added absolute references of the images in the AssetsvsFile. Thus, it is likely to show error on your IDE. To fix this, you may need to change my absolute references to yours.
